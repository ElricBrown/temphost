      <p>Passive fire protection pertains to the compartmentalization of an overall building through the use of Approved Fire Rated Materials acting together to compose a Fire Rated System. The overall building structure is then broken down into smaller fire compartments, consisting of one or more rooms and/or floors, known as fire zones. This compartmentalization prevents and/or slows the spread of fire from the area/compartment of fire origin to other areas within the fire zone, thus limiting damage and providing safe passage for the building occupants to evacuate the building.</p>
